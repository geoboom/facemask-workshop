# Welcome to The NUS Statistics Society Facemask Detector Workshop!

## View the workshop video [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NeKH1Ih0pQ)

**Note:** if you attended the workshop or cloned this repo before 18 September 2020, please type `git pull` while in the project folder to pull the latest code in which the backend is completed and everything should be working!

The purpose of this repo is to **help you get started with the basic tools :hammer: and code :computer:** needed to follow along in the workshop. It will also serve as the single source of truth, hosting the latest version of our facemask :mask: detector workshop material :books:.

We hope that you will find great joy and meaning in our workshop! :joy: Consider giving this repo a star :star: if you found it helpful!

# Pre-workshop installation guide

This guide covers the installation of:

- Anaconda - a distribution of python which comes with a lot of data science packages :package:.
- `jupyter notebook` - a live python execution environment typically used for exploratory :mag: data analysis.
- `nodejs` and `npm` - nodejs is a js (javascript) runtime built on chrome's V8 engine :car: and npm is a package manager for nodejs.

You may find the detailed installation instructions for your operating system (Linux/Mac/Windows) via the links below. We know the instructions might look pretty lengthy but it won't take more than 20 minutes! :pray::pray::pray:

If you use a **Windows** machine, click [here](windows.md).

If you use a **Mac**, click [here](mac.md).

If you use **Linux**, click [here](linux.md).

Please only follow **ONE** of the installation guides e.g. if you're using Mac please don't follow the Linux guide by accident. We can't help you with troubleshooting issues otherwise.

## I have problem üò≠üò≠. What do?

Please post a **[GitHub issue](https://github.com/geoboom/facemask-workshop/issues)** on this repo if you encounter any difficulties!

We'd love to help you, so do include as much information that could help us such as:

- error logs,
- your operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux),
- your `python3 --version`,
- the exact steps you took that led to the issue,
- etc.

Thank you :pray:

# Project setup

Follow the instructions below to get familiarized with the project repo. You may make reference to this section during the workshop itself to perform certain tasks :book:.

If you wish to access the incomplete pre-workshop code, type `git checkout workshop` to switch to the `workshop` branch (while in the project folder). To revert back to the `master` branch containing the working code, type `git checkout master`.

## Cloning this repo

1. Ensure you have the **latest system packages**.
   1. (For Windows/Linux) Open up terminal (wsl terminal for Windows) and type `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.
   2. (For Mac) Open up terminal and type `brew update && brew upgrade`.
2. Run `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/geoboom/facemask-workshop.git` to **clone this repo**.
   - **Troubleshooting:** if you get a `git command not found` error, run `sudo apt install git` first then try cloning the repo again.
3. Run `ls` and you should see a folder called `facemask-workshop`.

## Launching `jupyter notebook`

1. In terminal, type `cd facemask-workshop` to navigate to the project's root folder.
1. In the root folder, navigate to the **notebook subdirectory** by typing `cd notebook`.
1. Type `conda activate base` to **activate Anaconda's base environment**. You should see `(base)` beside your name in terminal.
1. Now run `jupyter notebook` (`jupyter notebook --no-browser` if you're on windows) and this notebook folder should open in Jupyter Notebook on your browser.
   - If you're on windows, copy the url that looks like `http://127.0.0.1..token=..` OR `http://localhost..token=..`displayed in the terminal and paste it in your browser. This is the url to your Jupyter Notebook.
   - **Troubleshooting:** if for some reason Jupyter Notebook in the browser does not show the files in `notebook/` folder, then go back to terminal and hit CTRL+C to stop the server. Once the server has stopped, run `jupyter notebook --no-browser --notebook-dir=.` and try accessing it on the browser again.

## Running the frontend (website)

1. **Open up a new terminal** and type `cd facemask-workshop` to navigate to the project's root folder.
1. In the root folder, navigate to the **frontend subdirectory** by typing `cd frontend`.
1. Type `npm install` to **install the frontend project dependencies** specified in `package.json`. This might take a while so grab a coffee :coffee:.
1. Once the dependencies have finished installing, type `npm run dev` to **run the website's server** (`nextjs`).
1. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser to **see the website live!**

## Running the backend (FastAPI server)

1. **Open up a new terminal** and type `cd facemask-workshop` to navigate to the project's root folder.
1. In the root folder, navigate to the **backend subdirectory** by typing `cd backend`.
1. Type `python3 -m venv venv` to create a `python3` virtual environment in the backend directory.
   - **Troubleshooting:** if you get an error regarding `pip`/`ensurepip`/`venv`, you most likely do not have `python3-venv` installed. To resolve this, run `sudo apt install python3-venv`.
1. Type `source venv/bin/activate` to **activate this virtual environment**. You should see `(venv)` beside your name, indicating that the `venv` environment is activated.
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to **install the dependencies** to this virtual environment, specified by `requirements.txt`. This might take a while so grab a coffee :coffee:. It is strongly advised that you run `pip install --upgrade pip` first.
   - **Troubleshooting:** if you get "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement opencv-contrib-python=4.4.0.42..." attempting this step, fret not. Just run `git pull` to fetch the latest changes (I most likely updated the repo after you cloned it) and re-do step 5.
1. Once dependencies have finished installing, type `./run.sh` to **run the FastAPI** server and hit enter.
